learning git and github\

Im learning git and github \
I started learning Dev and the first step to learn development was to learn git and github \

// install git bash from this website https://git-scm.com/downloads \
// watch videos and documentation to learn about commands in git bash  \
// make a repository and try to make changes, commit,merge and push them to githib repositories \
